# Frontend for Meetup mobile app

## What is Meetup?

Meetup is a mobile app that connects high school students based on similar interests. It was created during 2020 to solve the problem of depression among teenagers who, because of COVID, were not able to have social interactions as they would during a normal school year. By providing a platform where students can connect with each other based on shared interests, we can overcome COVID together. 

## Tech stack

The frontend is built with React Native for cross-platform development, Expo (a RN wrapper) for quicker and easier development, and Firebase for backend connections.
